# Houlahee Games

## Hi! This is Houlihan and her partner, Partner.

After years of criminal investigative work, we have decided to stop foolin' around and finally make games. After all, we got into solving crimes just as a preparation for our videogames. Best start with the easy stuff. We hope you like our games, because we are not going back into the field.

Our first game, <ins>Elvis in Culoz Remake</ins>, it's a reimagination of one of our first personal games made in Unity, **Elvis in Culoz**, which had Elvis platforming into nothingness at the entrance to the city of Las Vegas.

For now, Elvis in Culoz Remake remains in heavy development, but we are thrilled about being able to show it to you very soon in its full remade splendor. We hope it captures the probably late Elvis' horribly sad feeling of being unable to fly to Japan.
